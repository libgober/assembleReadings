# Course Description

This course provides a graduate-level introduction to the field of American Politics. This field is a big tent, covering at times objects of inquiry that may have little to do with one another, from the efficacy of electoral mobilization to Congress's attempts to influence the bureaucracy. Therefore, our goal is less canvasing the whole literature on American politics, and more giving you a sense of what topics are out there, how have these issues been investigated previously, and how recent contributions to scholarship look. 

# Expectations and Objectives

The primary goal of this course is professionalization. Some of you will be like me when I was at your stage, having taken few if any courses on American politics prior to starting graduate schools. Others may have been majors in political science who really did focus on this area. Given those differing experience sets, we have a challenge of talking across levels. That said, we are going to engage this material in a way that is fundamentally different from what everyone has experienced previously. Before, you were a consumer of knowledge. Now, you are a producer of knowledge. Of course, to produce you must consume, a lot. Particularly as you're in your early professional stages, you should consume as much as you possibly can and develop your *tastes* for scholarship.

Students are expected attend all classes and come prepared to discuss all of the assigned readings. Students may be asked to present assigned readings without prior notice. In so doing, students should be prepared to discuss main themes, contributions, problems, and unanswered questions. 

Each session after our first, a student will be appointed as discussion leader. You should expect to be discussion leader twice. I am happy to allow you to volunteer to discuss weeks that are more to your interest, that said every week needs discussion leaders. 

## Visitors

Where possible, I am going to have visitors to chat with us about American Politics. With the external visitors, we will spent a bit of time the session before and the session after debriefing.  

# Seminar Paper

Your seminar paper will involve an attempt to replicate an existing paper, with a non-trivial addition or extension. If you do quantitative work, articles  published in the last decade typically will have replication files, while earlier articles may not. If you do qualitative work, your replication process may be a little more challenging, but let's chat. If it's historical critical, then Chicago is a rich environemnt, and also you can do a lot online these days. If you're wanting to do interview based research, might be a challenge but there still might be something to do. 

Your interim short papers should describe incremental progress toward the final seminar paper. First paper should identify several possible papers. Second paper should present a plan for the replication process. Third short paper is an interim draft (50-60% of the final paper, with the time-consumming data collection stuff done or nearly done).

Students are expected to attend all classes, participate actively, complete assignments on time, and follow academic integrity guidelines. Office hours are available by appointment for additional support, clarification on course material, or discussions on related topics.

## Academic Integrity

Academic honesty is very important. Failures to comply with our community's standards of academic integrity are very costly. For more about these policies, you are encouraged to read the brochure [Academic Integrity: A Basic Guide ](https://weinberg.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/courses-registration-grades/integrity/) provided by WCAS. 

Most academic integrity policies have not had much opportunity to be tested against ChatGPT and other ``intelligent'' text generating systems. If you do use these systems, which is not necessary for this or any course, I would encourage you to do so judiciously and assuming that whatever content you are given by the tool is itself regurgitated from something already published elsewhere. Moreover, if you're passing off work published elsewhere as your own, expect to have the book thrown at you. Policies will likely err on the side of overly punitive in the short run. 

That said, these tools do have their uses. Some things that I've done with ChatGPT in my work:

- Formatting or reformatting citations. 
- Making a template of the readings for a course that meets M/W between 3/25 and 5/27 (see below).
- Transforming the template I wrote into a well-formatted table (see below)
- As a search engine (``Were there any particularly well-known articles about X topic?'')
- Condensing/revising notes so that they are more complete/coherent. (But CAREFUL, note this is playing with fire if you ever copy/paste your notes into your papers!)

Basically, I think of these tools as _very gifted_ at generating the form of an answer and occasionally giving you what Google would a bit faster. In general, these systems are not experts. Real experts notice these systems making serious mistakes that are also very unhuman-like. When they're most "spookily smart," one suspects it is because they're regurgitating their training material most directly, which is where you stray into the land of academic integrity violations. 

The single best thing you can do for your academic integrity is to download and religiously use a reference manager such as Zotero (my preferred choice), Mendeley, or others. A major benefit of these is that they make entering, formating, and reformating citations painless.

## Accessibility and Accommodations

Students with disabilities who require accommodations for equal access to this course are encouraged to contact the instructor at the beginning of the term. Accommodations will be provided in coordination with the campus disability services office.
